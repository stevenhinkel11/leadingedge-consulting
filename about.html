                <p class="subhead">Going beyond surveys to create meaningful change</p>
                <p>While many cultural assessments rely on surveys and questionnaires, we take a more immersive approach. Our methodology involves direct engagement with your team, creating opportunities for authentic reflection and discovery. We believe that true cultural transformation happens when people are actively involved in the process, not just responding to checkboxes.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy & Approach</h2>
                <p>At Leading Edge Consulting, we believe that organizations and their people thrive when they have a clear understanding of who they are and how they operate. Our mission is to illuminate the often-unseen cultural dynamics that influence performance, relationships, and outcomes.</p>
                
                <p>Every organization has cultural blind spots—subtle patterns that, if left unexamined, can hinder progress and collaboration. We specialize in identifying these patterns using adapted methods from cultural anthropology, then guiding teams through a practical process to bridge the gap between their current and desired culture.</p>
                
                <p>Our work is grounded in empathy, evidence, and action—because clarity isn't just informative, it's transformative.</p>
